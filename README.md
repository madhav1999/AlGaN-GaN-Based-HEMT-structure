# AlGaN-GaN-Based-HEMT-structure

This Project consists programs related to the simulations of HEMT(High Electron Mobility Transistor).These codes are written for SILVACO TCAD simulation tool.
It mainly concerned about improvement of breakdown performance of the respective simulated transistor along with optimisation of other transistor characteristics.
